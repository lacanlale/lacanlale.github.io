# [04-09-2020] Starting post
So I think I've created and deleted a github pages more than I count because of indecisiveness but I think I've finally gotten it down. 
I'll be using this blog to keep track of some projects I've worked on as well as a mini preview of my academic achievements as a researcher along the way. Cheers to sticking to a new blog! ðŸ¥‚
