# [04-14-2020] Twitter Poll Projects: Everyone is me [2/???]
If you've read my starting post, I'm using these Twitter Poll Projects as a fun way to keep up with the literature. That said, the papers influencing this work are as follows:

- [FaceShifter: Towards High Fidelity And Occlusion Aware Face Swapping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.13457.pdf) (2019) *Lingzhi Li et. al*
- [Swapped Face Detection using Deep Learning and Subjective Assessment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04217.pdf) (2019) *Xinyi Ding et. al*
- [FSNet: An Identity-Aware Generative Model for Image-based Face Swapping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12666.pdf) (2018) *Ryota Natsume et. al*

**\*Quick Side Note**: I'll be doing my best to keep the papers I cite open-access because I am a firm believer and supporter of open-science, open-source, open-\*. I'll also try to keep the papers I cite fairly recent, usually in the past 3-5 years.

To be brief, Paper 1 (FaceShifter) is where I'll be drawing the most reference too seeing as it has the best success results and is fairly recent. The premise of the paper was combining two networks, one for creating the facial swap and the other for error correction. The paper clearly breaks down their methods, providing details on how they retain specific details such as lighting, occulusions (hair/glasses), and results that prove to be fairly better than other methods. The additional two papers were extra material related to the field. From here, I'll be focusing on diving into GAN's and image generation.

*\*\*This is a tag that gets attached to all my Twitter Poll Projects. If you think this is a cool process, you can follow me on [DEV](https://dev.to/lacanlale) for iterative updates. Twitter Poll Projects are also something I like to post about on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/frogathan) and you're also welcome to follow me and give feedback as time goes on. If you have suggestions or ideas that you think are worth trying, feel free to DM me and it might end up in the next poll.\*\**
